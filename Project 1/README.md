# CompSci Project 1

We studied numerous regression methods, in order to master the supervised Machine Learning. Our algorithms were used for in depth analysis of Ordinary Least Squares method, Ridge and Lasso Regression as well as few optimization techniques. Additionally, Logistic Regression was applied in classification problem. Linear regression approaches were also coupled with common resampling methods. This study equipped us with better understanding of simple ML algorithms, helped us recognize their weaknesses and strengths. We identify and report here the most accurate approaches for each problem studied.
